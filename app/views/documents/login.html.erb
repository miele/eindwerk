<p>This is an example browser application for Google Documents built using the GDocs4Ruby Gem.</p>
<p>You can get the source code for this example here: <a href='/examples/gdocs4ruby_example.zip'>example source</a>.</p>
<p>Enter your google documents credentials below.  All information is stored by session only - no personal information is saved.  But obviously use a test account - this is not production code, so don't be suprised if something doesn't work like you expect it to.</p>
